## Stack
_Vue.js, HTML, CSS + Bootstrap, JavaScript_

## Why We Chose This Stack
We decided to use Vue over more popular frameworks such as React because of the variety of developers
in the club. Some have just begun their studies while others are established in their careers. Vue is already
placed in several web development courses at Franklin giving a broad exposure.
